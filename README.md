**Game Title:** Prophecy: Daybreak

**Game Description:**
Our game is best described as a top-down 2-D wave defense game, with the genre being set as a modern sci-fi action game.
Our game’s core gameplay loop consists of the player moving around the map to kill the enemies that spawn.
The player continuously kills enemies until they kill all spawned enemies and move to the next wave, or until they run out of health and die.
Enemies can occasionally drop health pick-ups that will heal the player, enabling them to progress further.
If the player passes all waves, they will win the game and be presented with a victory screen.
